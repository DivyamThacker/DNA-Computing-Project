    Description:
      "Founded by MIT scientists, CATALOG is the world's first company to develop a commercially viable system to convert zeros and ones used to store binary data in traditional storage into a combination of pre-synthesized DNA molecules. Shannon can easily fit in a family kitchen and uses technology derived from office printers to automate the encoding of data into DNA, which can scale to meet emerging commercial needs. She speeds the writing process and helps minimize costs, a critical step to making DNA storage practical. Shannon can convert warehouses of traditional storage systems into a sugar cube-sized container of DNA that can remain stable for thousands of years.",
